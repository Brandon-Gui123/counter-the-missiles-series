# counter-the-missiles-series

This repository contains the multiple versions of the first game I made, which was submitted for my polytechnic's assignment, that can be played on both mobile and desktop.

I wanted to create this repository as a way to show the progress I made on these games.

P.S. Would have been better to create webpages explaining these games but I figured that this is
better for now, until I find a better time later to do webpages.
