# The Release Folder

This folder contains playable builds of the game. You can download and try these builds on supported devices.

The game currently supports Windows and macOS (and soon, Android).

# Get the Right Version
## Windows users
Click on the file named "Counter the Missiles (Windows x86).zip" and then click "Download", which appears near the right.

Once downloaded, right-click on the .zip folder and select "Extract All". Choose anywhere to extract the contents to.

Once extraction is complete, click on the .exe file to run the game.

Because this file is an executable file (.exe), anti-virus programs may mark this as a potential virus and would take it down. When such an incident occurs, just restore it. Rest-assured. I don't put viruses in there because I have better things to do.

Upon launching the file, you may see this:

You can leave the settings as it is and just hit the "Play!" button on the lower right corner.

But if you want to change those settings, here's on what those settings mean:

### Screen Resolution
On the first dropdown menu, you can choose the screen resolution of the game. Lower resolutions result in higher performance, but will cause the game to look blurry. Since Counter the Missiles is a simple game, using a high resolution should be fine.

### Graphics Quality
On the second dropdown menu, you can choose the quality of the game. For now, this setting doesn't do anything in the game.

### Select Monitor
If you've connected multiple extended displays on your computer, you can choose which display to show the game on.

By default, the game shows on your primary display. But if you want to change that, click on the dropdown menu and choose another display.

### Windowed
On the right, you can choose if you want to "window" the game or let it take up the whole screen space of your computer.

### Input tab
This game does not utilize such inputs. So please ignore that.

## macOS users
Click on the file named "Counter the Missiles (macOS).app" and then click "Download", which appears near the right.

Once downloaded, simply left-click on the downloaded file. This will launch the game.

You may see the following window when launching the game:

![Play Window on macOS](Play_Window_macOS.png)

You can leave the settings at default and simply hit on "Play!" (on the bottom-right corner of the window) to start playing the game.

But if you want to adjust the settings, here's on what those settings mean:

### Screen Resolution
On the left, you can choose the screen resolution of the game. Lower resolutions result in higher performance, but will cause the game to look blurry. Since Counter the Missiles is a simple game, using a high resolution should be fine.

### Graphics Quality
On the right, you can choose the quality of the game. For now, this setting doesn't do anything in the game.

### Windowed
On the bottom of the Screen Resolution dialog, you can choose if you want to "window" the game or let it take up the whole screen space of your computer.

### Graphics Device to Use
Here, you can choose which graphics device to use for running this game. By default, the game is set to automatically use the best graphics device to render the game.

Note that this option may be greyed out if you only have one graphics device.

### Only show this dialog if the option key is down
If this option is checked, this window will only open when the option key is pressed down while the game is launched.

### Quiting and Saving Preferences
Clicking on "Quit" simply closes the window. This is the same as clicking on the red button on the top-left corner or hitting âŒ˜ + Q.

Clicking on "Save and Quit" closes the window and saves your choices you made for the screen resolution and graphics quality. Note that this doesn't save your preferences on running the game in fullscreen or windowed mode.

The next time you open the game, your preferences will be preserved.

### Input tab
This game does not utilize such inputs. So please ignore that.
